# VoxelAO

Run premake.bat to generate Visual Studio 2013 project in build/ dir.

Small ambient occlusion demo using voxelized geometry and a ray marching kernel. WIP, needs some filtering/blur/noise to smooth the "blocky" results. The sample kernel is very basic and need tweaking.

Results are completely independent from the viewing angle.
